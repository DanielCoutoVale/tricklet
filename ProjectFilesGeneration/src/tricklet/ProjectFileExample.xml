The flora and fauna of the Ice Age differ dramatically from that of today. A new study focusing on the \par\par
birds of the Ice Age has shed light on the long-term response of birds to climate change. The research \par\par
shows that the population of British birds in the Ice Age was larger suggesting the richness of the \par\par
environment at this time. John Stewart from Bournemouth University and researcher Roger Jacobi found out \par\par
that there was an unusual mix of birds in one space and a distinct dawn chorus. The mixtures of birds that \par\par
lived together were different from anywhere in the world today. Birds exotic to Britain, such as species \par\par
normally expected in the tundra to the north, the Mediterranean to the South or the Eastern steppes lived \par\par
together with birds expected in the region today. John Stewart stated: \'93It is clear that the change of \par\par
prehistoric birds in Britain resembles that of mammals. It also signifies that the dawn chorus witnessed \par\par
by the Neanderthals at that time and place has no parallels anywhere today.\'94}
