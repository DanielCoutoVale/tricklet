# Tricklet

This toolset was developed to automate tasks in preparing translation experiments within [the TRICKLET project](http://www.anglistik.rwth-aachen.de/go/id/gceg/lidx/1) (RWTH Aachen University), which is funded by [the German Research Foundation (DFG)](http://dfg.de) from 1st March 2014 to 28th February 2017.

The experimental design, which supported the creation of this toolset, was proposed by researchers in the CAPES-DAAD PROBRAL 292/2008 project and is to be reported on in a future paper.
